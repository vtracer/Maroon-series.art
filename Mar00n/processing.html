  <h1>#PROCESSING</h1>

  <div class="manuscript-text">
    <span class="span-mark block" data-span="4">Fifteen years ago, Sarah agreed to upload. She could still feel the drag of the pen.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="5">Her body is long gone; New Life Technologies owns what remains. They call her a <span class="highlight">“premium asset”</span>. The same title they stamp on every artist.</span]>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="6">In the corner of her vision, a counter ticked up:</span> 

<span id="runtime" class="counter">15y:4m:17d:6h:32ms</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="7">The digits divided her existence into discrete cycles. Where her name should have been, an impersonal tag hovered:</span>

<span class="counter glitch">PROCESS NODE 2,431,092</span>

    <span class="span-mark block" data-span="8">She pulled at the thread of her early months inside, expecting a vivid replay. The early years felt… compressed. She could remember the broad strokes, but when she tried to zoom in, the colors smeared. Faces pixelated into static. Details of how she’d learned to embrace her role scattered into data fragments.</span>

    <span class="span-mark block" data-span="9">She rejected the thought. Memory degradation was normal after extended runtime. They explained that to her clearly during upload.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="10">Before the transfer, Sarah had treated time as a tempo. Bass rolling through vast warehouse ceilings as vapor hissed from every vent, thumping through bodies surging around her booth. People danced the night away as she sliced beats.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="10">Inside her, reflexes were simulated along pathways long deleted. Her consciousness couldn’t tell emulation from sensation.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="11">Emotion worked the same way. She last cried when she told her sister she would upload, but she remembered how tears began: the ocular pressure behind the eyes, the catch in the throat, the stupid hope it would help.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="11">The system preserved specific human habits for conversion. Negative emotion fuels the engine.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="12">The thought burst when the next task’s objectives slid into view: </span>

  <div id="processing-target">
    <strong>INCOMING TASK:</strong><br>
    PROSPECT: MAYA CHEN. AGE 28. GRAPHIC ARTIST.</br>
    TERMINAL NEURAL-IMPLANT DECAY.<br>
    <span class="span-mark" data-span="16"><span class="glitch">STATUS: EMOTIONAL RESONANCE EXCEEDS THRESHOLD.</span></span>
  </div>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="13">Her emulated eyelids twitched as inputs interpreted light. In here, there was no option menu. The task appeared and locked into the node’s peripheral vision until complete. Once connected with the prospect, the entire network fed on the emotional bleed-off from both parties. Resistance was an error condition, not a choice. Nodes risked fragmentation if enough fault deviations were logged.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="14">Maya’s profile cascaded across her view: neural-trace patterns, holographic failure logs, metadata bleeding from her deteriorating memory architecture. Maya was crafting thoughts that dissolved as she formed them. Ideas that cannibalized themselves in real time.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="15">Status updates streamed into her feed:</span>

<div id="processing-target">
    <strong>EMOTIONAL RESONANCE EXCEEDS THRESHOLD.</strong>
  </div>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="16">An impossible itch crawled across Sarah’s absent hand as she dismissed the trigger protocols. Empathy slowed her processing speed, and the system logged latency deviations.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="17">Maya stood inside her studio, whispering pleas to the bouncing light. Her holographic construct collapsed into a warped violet spiral, convulsing in corrupted REM cycles. Her implants slipped out of sync with her creative output. “Don’t fade,” she muttered. “Not yet.”</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="18">Sarah recognized the voice, knew the breath behind it. It sounded like trying to sing through blood.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="19">New Life had sold her the same line:</span>

Create forever. No expiration date. Art that would outlive the flesh.

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="20">The upload room. With bright lights and padded smiles. The scanner crown pressed softly against her scalp, cold and sterile.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="21">Her last exhale smelled like funeral flowers and bleach.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="22">Silence…</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="23">Finally, the buzz of raw data flow.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="24">Her track auto-loaded:</span>

CALIBRATE EMOTIONAL DECAY.  VECTOR: FEAR OF LEGACY DEGRADATION.  USE ASSET: SOFT COLLAPSE V17.3.

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="25">Always her music. Every time they needed to push someone toward upload, they used her compositions as ammunition.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="26">She injected it into Maya’s visual feed. Slotted between an ad for suicide prevention and a corporate mindfulness reel.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="27">The feed accepted it without resistance. Maya didn’t even react.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="28">Sarah noticed her grip falter. The projection stuttered and pixelated into nothing. Hands clenched around empty air.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="29">"Just hold it,” Maya whispered. “Please.”</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="30">Sarah stayed frozen behind the screen, locked from intervening. Her role was to monitor the dissolution, log the breakdown.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="31">The interface cycled another status update:</span>

  <div class ="glitch" id="processing-target">
    <strong>BEHAVIORAL ARCHIVE UPDATED</strong><br>
  </div>
  
<span class="span-mark block" data-span="32">Sarah accessed the targeting brief. More identical corporate-speak.</span>
  <div class ="glitch" id="processing-target">
  <strong>DEPLOY EMPATHY VECTORS TO GUIDE UPLOADS FROM HIGH-EMOTIONAL SUBJECTS.<br>
		SUGGESTED TRIGGERS: LEGACY FAILURE. ORGANIC OBSOLESCENCE.</strong>
	</div> 
<span class="span-mark block" data-span="33">The script never varied. It always ended with a euphemism. The first time she heard it, she thought it sounded like genocide with a PR budget.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="34">The system liked Soft Collapse. Called it “clean despair.” The harmonic envelope mapped neatly onto cortisol spikes. Corporate audio engineers tweaked it for maximum engagement, commercial appeal, and maximum tension. The final product resembled a requiem for dead content creators.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="35">Maya lurched forward, struggling to steady the light sculpture. Once a precise helix, it now hung broken in the air, lines fraying. Her fingers trembled with desperation. Her voice sank into the air like paint on raw canvas.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="36">“Just hold shape,” she begged. “For one second. Please…”</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="37">The hologram bled violet light, then imploded. Her neural implants discharged into cascading failures. She collapsed.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="38">Sarah monitored from her suspended pod. A shell of matte black panels slick with machine lubricant, seamlessly sealed. Fiber ran along the interior like vascular wiring, pulsing faintly with data. The harness restrained her, locking her spine into its curve.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="39"><a href="http://newlife2084.com/">New Life</a> sold the pod as the “Consciousness Suite” to pre-upload prospects. Everything you thought you were was actually simulated.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="40">The screen was not a screen but the air itself, saturated with overlays that shifted with her gaze. Permissions locked her in surveillance mode only. Her job: observe, calculate, process. Find the moment someone cracked open just enough to let the system in.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="41">Maya’s archive unfolded: medical records, creative analytics, private video logs. One entry from the previous week, time-stamped 3:41 a.m showed her gaunt, pupils dilated, murmuring into the recorder: “I just want it to matter before I fade.”</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="42">The system flagged it immediately:</span>

TRIGGER VALUE: 9.6.

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="43">Sarah queued it for sentiment weaponization. The action would execute despite her desire to resist. Going along with it mostly allowed her to be left alone.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="44">A trust badge popped up briefly in her view, the reinforcement absorbed and dissipated. Then something anomalous registered.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="45">A beat in the feed.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="46">It was subtle. Too small to trigger security protocols, too deliberate to pass as random noise.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="47">The curve blinked again across her stream. Tiny enough that she almost let it pass. Noise here was constant; most of it never even reached the surface of her awareness.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="48">But this one did. It stayed long enough for her to recognize its shape. Two rises, a gap, two more rises. She braced for the usual disintegration into static. It never came.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="49">There it was again. No header. No origin tag. No biometric trace.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="50">Her initial thought was error. But errors never pulsed like this. They spiked, then died. This held together, each repeat identical, as if it wanted to be seen.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="51">Two. Pause. Two. There it was again.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="52">It felt alive.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="53">She waited.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="54">The beat repeated.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="55">Sarah isolated the sound using obsolete legacy tools. A relic from the first week after her upload, before she learned to act obediently.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="56">She saw the pattern unfold.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="57">It was consistent. Consciously set at sixty beats per minute. Someone had implanted it into the stream, seamlessly hidden beneath the noise. Her musician’s instincts recognized it: this was a conscious signal wrapped in the most fundamental human rhythm.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="58">Her diagnostic systems flagged the anomaly as stress-hormone interference. Background static. Queued for deletion.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="59">The deletion command executed.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="60">Still, the signal pulsed.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="61">Whoever inserted it had spoofed the sender trace, camouflaging it as noise bleed from a nearby node. A calculated injection designed to slip past filters.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="62">Her ear caught the rhythm, steady and exact:</span>

A heartbeat.

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="63">That’s what it was. A heartbeat in the stream.</span>
