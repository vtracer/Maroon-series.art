  <h1>#PROCESSING</h1>

  <div class="manuscript-text">
    <span class="span-mark block" data-span="4">Fifteen years ago, Sarah agreed to upload. She could still feel the drag of the pen.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="5">Her body is long gone; New Life Technologies owns what remains. They call her a <span class="highlight">“premium asset”</span>. The same title they stamp on every artist.</span]>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="6">In the corner of her vision, a counter ticked up:</span> 

15y:4m:17d:6h:17m:32ms. 

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="7">The digits divided her existence into discrete cycles. Where her name should have been, an impersonal tag hovered:</span>

PROCESS NODE 2,431,092. 

    <span class="span-mark block" data-span="8">She pulled at the thread of her early months inside, expecting a vivid replay. The early years felt… compressed. She could remember the broad strokes, but when she tried to zoom in, the colors smeared. Faces pixelated into static. Details of how she’d learned to embrace her role scattered into data fragments.</span>

    <span class="span-mark block" data-span="9">She rejected the thought. Memory degradation was normal after extended runtime. They explained that to her clearly during upload.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="10">Before the transfer, Sarah had treated time as a tempo. Bass rolling through vast warehouse ceilings as vapor hissed from every vent, thumping through bodies surging around her booth. People danced the night away as she sliced beats.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="10">Inside her, reflexes were simulated along pathways long deleted. Her consciousness couldn’t tell emulation from sensation.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="11">Emotion worked the same way. She last cried when she told her sister she would upload, but she remembered how tears began: the ocular pressure behind the eyes, the catch in the throat, the stupid hope it would help.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="11">The system preserved specific human habits for conversion. Negative emotion fuels the engine.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="12">The thought burst when the next task’s objectives slid into view: </span>

  </div>

  <div id="processing-target">
    <strong>INCOMING TASK:</strong><br>
    PROSPECT: MAYA CHEN. AGE 28. GRAPHIC ARTIST.</br>
    TERMINAL NEURAL-IMPLANT DECAY.<br><br>

    <span class="span-mark" data-span="16"><span class="glitch">STATUS: EMOTIONAL RESONANCE EXCEEDS THRESHOLD.</span></span>
  </div>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="13">Her emulated eyelids twitched as inputs interpreted light. In here, there was no option menu. The task appeared and locked into the node’s peripheral vision until complete. Once connected with the prospect, the entire network fed on the emotional bleed-off from both parties. Resistance was an error condition, not a choice. Nodes risked fragmentation if enough fault deviations were logged.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="14">Maya’s profile cascaded across her view: neural-trace patterns, holographic failure logs, metadata bleeding from her deteriorating memory architecture. Maya was crafting thoughts that dissolved as she formed them. Ideas that cannibalized themselves in real time.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="15">Status updates streamed into her feed:</span>

<div id="processing-target">
    <strong>EMOTIONAL RESONANCE EXCEEDS THRESHOLD.</strong>
  </div>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="16">An impossible itch crawled across Sarah’s absent hand as she dismissed the trigger protocols. Empathy slowed her processing speed, and the system logged latency deviations.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="17">Maya stood inside her studio, whispering pleas to the bouncing light. Her holographic construct collapsed into a warped violet spiral, convulsing in corrupted REM cycles. Her implants slipped out of sync with her creative output. “Don’t fade,” she muttered. “Not yet.”</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="18">Sarah recognized the voice, knew the breath behind it. It sounded like trying to sing through blood.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="19">New Life had sold her the same line:</span>

Create forever. No expiration date. Art that would outlive the flesh.

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="20">The upload room. With bright lights and padded smiles. The scanner crown pressed softly against her scalp, cold and sterile.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="21">Her last exhale smelled like funeral flowers and bleach.</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="22">Silence…</span>

<span class="span-mark block" data-span="23">Finally, the buzz of raw data flow.</span>
